# Sisyphus was here

## Creative process

  Thinking about Sisyphean forms of struggle was a tough thing for me, not that I find it difficult to make torturing programs, I simply never came up with a repetitively futile method.
  
  What can be done over and over again, attempted forever without ever succeeding. 
  I wanted it to be simple, as I value simplicity in game design. It's often the most simple mechanics that lead to the most possibilities. 
  I thought I will make the player type out Sisyphus but as they got to the last s it would simply erase it. Forever typing s, so close yet so far away from finishing the word. However I felt like the frustration of Sisphean struggle is in the process of starting over.
  So everytime they type S it should erase the whole word ? But, then I thought on how I would accomplish that, make typing S a function that would reset the whole text box, that was the initial thought, but sisyphus starts with s. That would make the whole thing reset on start. So I started thinking of what could I have the player type in order to trigger the reset. Then I came upon "Sisyphus was here" I could have the R trigger the reset, it makes sense as R stands for reset or restart. From there on I set out to write a program which made typing the letter r reset the whole input box. I also decided to mess around with the myth a little by making it so that if the player decides to copy paste the line into the text box it would tell them off. Saying that Zeus would never let anyone help Sisyphus complete his tax. 
  
  Taking into consideration that the player might decide to try something other than the typing of the actual message i forged a lie. Saying there is a real game behind this simple lock, all the player has to do to access it is type the message. Giving a goal in a situation such as this one is the same as giving hope, hope for the greek myths prisoners that if they manage to complete their task they can go on living.
  
  I also decided to have some fun with them by hurdling insults at them for trying to type random stuff, and taunts for failing at typing the required. 
In order to make the experience more responsive, I changed the program from resetting on the letter R and made it reset exactly if the person types “Sisyphus was her” to stop them from finishing the sentence, and if they wanted to try something else they could hit enter to try it out. 

Finally I commissioned an artist friend of mine for an art of Sisyphus pushing the boulder up a mountain that i placed inside a banner at the bottom of the page. I put a parallax effect on the banner so that as the insults pile up they push the banner down going from the top of the mountain all the way down to where Sisyphus is struggling to push the boulder up.
